            The AP is an independent non-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City. While the
            organization is well known for its reporting and journalism, it also offers a suite of metadata
            services. Clients can submit their own content to receive relevant metadata tags in order to
            identify important topics, increase search relevance, and deliver targeted results. The current
            metadata system tags approximately 100,000 pieces of media content every day.

            <b>Existing System</b><br>
            Currently, the AP Tagging Service returns tags from a list of standardized vocabularies known as
            the AP News Taxonomy. The News Taxonomy is a set of hierarchically structured topics and names
            across five broad categories: Person, Geography, Company, Organization, and Subject. Person contains
            a list of individuals who are well-known nationally or globablly, with a special focus on the United
            States. Geography is a set of hierarchical place names, ranging from continents and countries to
            cities and towns. Company contains over 50,000 publicly traded companies, while Organization focuses
            on a diverse range of sectors, from government organizations and political institutions to
            universities and sports teams. Subject contains broad topics like Crime to the specific
            subtopics like illegal firearms. In total, there are over 165,000 possible tags. These lists are
            manually maintained and updated.

            The Tagging Service identifies phrases in submitted content that match items in the News
            Taxonomy. It also uses a set of manually-created if-then rules to identify other topics that
            might apply. These tags are added as metadata at the beginning of each piece of content passed
            through the AP's system.

            <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows a preview of the rules used by AP's current system.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Current Limitations</b><br>
            We identified three main limitations in the AP's current tagging system.

            First, the existing human-created if-then rules are lengthy, complicated to write, and difficult
            to maintain. They also generally rely on simple checks such as the presence or absence of
            certain words, which, without context, can lead to mistakes. One example of this can be seen in
            <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>. This article is about the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution"
              target="_blank">USS Constitution</a>, a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United
            States Navy, named after the US Constitution. The article itself does not have anything to do with
            the US Constitution, but the first topic highlighted by AP's metadata system is "Constitutions,"
            which is clearly incorrect.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the rules, the entire set of possible tags depends on manual maintenance. If a
            person does not add a tag to the News Taxonomy, it will never appear in metadata, no matter how
            relevant it may be to an article. For example, this flaw is particularly apparent in sports
            articles, which <a href="#visualized_data">comprise a majority</a> of all coverage. Teams and
            player rosters change frequently, and if someone is not constantly updating the News Taxonomy,
            the appropriate people and organizations will not be identified and tagged accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the existing tagging system can only identify the presence or
            absence of a topic. This binary system cannot score, rank, or sort the topics it identifies.
            This makes it impossible to understand the degree to which a particular piece of content is
            about​ a given topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, these limitations we found are certainly not desirable, as they could lead to inaccurate
            search results, ultimately reducing the disoverability of content and increasing the number of
            customer complaints the AP receives.

        <div class="col col-md-12">
          <p>
            <b>Addional Motivations</b><br>
            In order to create a better tagging system, we need to first understand what "better" means.
            This is why an important aspect of our project is the idea of "ground truth." Aside from
            anecdotes and discovered examples like the USS Constitution article <a href="#figure2">above</a>,
            we do not have any measure of the accuracy of the AP's current taxonomy and metadata tagging system.
            The AP's current methods involve spot-checking current rules and monitoring customer complaints to
            measure how well their taxonomy identifies topics and entities within content. They do not have
            a formal set of "ground truth" or "gold standard" good and bad tagging examples, which would be
            useful for more advanced tagging systems involving supervised learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, an important goal for our project is the ability for the AP and their clients to record
            feedback of both their current tagging system, as well as our project's topic and named entity
            identification system. This allows individuals to identify good tags and bad tags for any given
            article and save those in a log. This will ultimately assist in building a ground truth dataset,
            and hopefully lead to employing semi-supervised methods to dynamically score and rank tags
            globally across a corpus of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            These limitations and motivations lead us to the following problem statement:
          </p>
          <h3 style="color: #ed473b">How can we increase the AP's metadata accuracy and filter relevant tags
            in order to improve article discoverability, reduce customer complaints, and build ground
            truth?</h3>

            <b>Raw Data</b><br>
            In its raw form, the data we used for this project is a corpus of 50,000 .xml files. Each
            file is an AP news article that has been passed through the AP Tagging Service and
            enriched with metadata from the News Taxonomy. Our corpus contains articles published between
            September 2017 and February 2018. <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a> contains an excerpt from one such .xml
            file, showing
            the "SubjectClassification" tags for that particular article.

            To explore the raw data, we parsed each file based on its xml structure. We wrote
            Python scripts to parse each article into a row of a Pandas DataFrame. This format allowed us
            to conduct an exploratory data analysis of our corpus, seen in <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>.
            We also initially saved the body of each article as an individual .txt file in order to apply
            the <a href="#modeling">modeling</a> methods outlined below. For our analysis, we focus specifically
            on AP-generated tags categorized as "SubjectClassification" and "EntityClassification." We refer to
            these as subject and entity tags, respectively.

            <b>Visualized Data</b>
            <br>
            When we plot the frequency of subject tags in the corpus, as displayed in <a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>,
            we see the majority of articles are tagged with "Sports," "General News," or "Government and Politics."
            This is not surprising, but gives us important information about the distribution of tags within our
            corpus.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also many single letter tags like "s," "a," and "n." These tags are a part of
            <a href="http://www.eznews.com/help/ezsend/index.html?ANPAStandard" target="_blank">an international
              standard</a>
            developed by the International Press Telecommunications Council and Newspapers Association of America,
            formerly known as the American Newspaper Publishers Association (ANPA). They refer to categories such as "s"
            - Sports,
            including packages, "a" - Domestic, non-Washington, general news item, "n" - State and regional.
            These tags are commonly included to increase search relevance of AP articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also important to note that for any given article, there is often significant double tagging for
            certain categories such as "Sports" or "General News".

            They identify proper nouns - people, places, things - a particular article is
            about.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our corpus contains strictly English-language content, it follows that the majority of
            articles have entity tags such as "North America" and "United States." Since our corpus contains
            stories from a very politicized time period, "Donald Trump" shows up at the sixth most
            frequent entity tag followed by "National Football League."

            <b>Identifying & scoring tags</b><br>
            Throughout this project we explored multiple methods for identifying and scoring tags within
            each article. An important scoring tool design consideration was identifying tags that are both
            locally important (within each article headline and body), as well as globally important (within
            our corpus of articles). To that end, we used named entity extraction to identify key terms in each
            document, and then compute a term frequency-inverse document weight for each of these terms. We combine this
            score with an additional score based on article heuristics to return a list of ranked tags.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!--Named Entity Extraction-->
      <div class="row">
        <div id="namedentity" class="col col-md-6">
          <p>
            <b>Named Entity Extraction</b><br>
            People, places, organizations, and companies are all examples of named entities. We use this concept
            to help determine what a given article is about. Named-entity extraction (NEE) is the process of identifying
            and isolating these types of proper nouns from a piece of text. We use the Python library
            <a href="https://spacy.io/" target="_blank">Spacy</a> to extract entities from each article in our corpus.
            We intentionally chose to focus on identifying tags based on named entities (similar to the AP's Person,
            Company,
            Organization, and Geography tags) instead of placing articles into broader categories (like the AP subject
            tags),
            with the understanding that the former may also be helpful in determining the latter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply extracting a named entity from an article extablishes its local importance, but this is not enough.
            For
            example, many articles may mention a person's name, particularly a common one such as Hillary Clinton,
            without
            necessarily being about that term. Thus, it is important to have some measure of the global importance of a
            term,
            relative to other articles.

            <b>Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency></b><br>
            Every word that appears in a document is not necessarily important for understanding what that
            document is about. For example, words like "the" or "a" help put a cohesive sentence together,
            but do not give us information regarding what an article is really about. Term Frequency-Inverse
            Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a way of determining the importance of a term within a document
            and across a corpus of documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our corpus, as outlined above, contains 50,000 articles. For any word in one of those articles,
            "term frequency" is the number of times that word occurs in that individual document. The
            "inverse document frequency" is the logarithm of the total number of documents in the corpus
            divided by the number of documents that contain that specific word. In other words, term
            frequency signifies how significant a particular word is within a document, and the inverse
            document frequency of that term represents its significance
            in the entire corpus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency can tell us how rare a word
            is: the higher the score, the more special it is in that document. As mentioned earlier, a key consideration
            of the
            scoring tool must be to analyze a tag’s importance locally as well as globally. TF-IDF helps us
            achieve that.

          <p><b>Article Heuristics</b><br>
            As previously noted, we also apply article heuristics to augment each entity's TF-IDF score. For
            example,
            if an entity shows up at the beginning or headline of an article, its score will be increased,
            and vice
            versa for entities that show up towards the end of an article. The rationale for this
            augmentation being that articles typically have their principal topics mentioned earlier in an
            article's body. These simple scoring heuristics are easily expanded and tuned.

            <b>TextRank</b><br>
            TextRank is an algorithm developed by <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-3252">Mihaelcea and
            Tarau </a>
            that identifies keywords within a single document. It creates a graph with all words from a document
            that may be possible keywords as vertices, and adds edges between two vertices (two possible keywords)
            if they occur within a certain window of a predefined size (typically between 2 and 10 words).
            An edge would be weighted by the number of times the possible keywords occur within the same window.
            The computation for the TextRank score for the vertices repeats until values converge.
          </p>
          <p>
            TextRank looks at the structure of each article in isolation, while TF-IDF looks at the
            counts of terms within an article as well as the entire corpus of articles. For this reason we
            hypothesized that they may work well together. We initially implemented a version of TextRank in which the
            scoring mechanism for the possible keywords was weighted by a TF-IDF score, but we eventually
            decided not to continue with this approach because the tags generated with named entity
            extraction and TF-IDF were more relevant.

          <p>
            <b>Overview</b>
            <br>
            This project is a RESTful API, built with Python and Flask, and containerized with Docker. It
            incorporates a modular design, separating the parsing, tag identification, scoring, and sorting
            of media files from the web application itself. We use both
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> when building
            our TF-IDF matrix and the AP's
            <a href="https://developer.ap.org/ap-metadata-services" target="_blank">Metadata Services</a>
            API for tagging new content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our application uses six primary modules:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <a href="#count_entities.py">count_entities.py</a>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#compare.html">compare.html</a>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This modular design is illustrated above in Figure 9 and explained in detail below. In our
            project, the media files we are using as a corpus are XML news articles previously enriched
            by AP's metadata tagging service.

          To install the tag comparison and validation tool on your local system follow these steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Clone this repository using <code>$ git clone https://github.com/aefernandes/ac297r.git</code></li>
            <li>Navigate to the cloned repository</li>
            <li>Run <code>make data</code> to create the data directories (not stored in version control)</li>
            <li>Copy any number of article XML files into the new raw data directory — these are assumed to be named
              exactly as they were given to us, i.e. `<code>{articleid}.xml</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Run <code>docker-compose build</code> to build the images.</li>
            <li>Run <code>docker-compose up pipeline</code> to do the IDF pre-processing step.</li>
            <li>Run <code>docker-compose up web</code> to do the IDF pre-processing step.</li>
            <li>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:5000/" class="uri">http://localhost:5000/</a> in your browser</li>
            <li>By default, user feedback will be persisted to <code>feedback.json</code>, but this can easily be
              pointed to output to a relational database.

            <b>count_entities.py</b>This module runs as a standalone script which computes the named entities
            for each article and seralizes them to disk as an intermediate, compute-intensive step before
            the "matrix" of document counts and IDF scores. This module was run on an AWS
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g3/" target="_blank">g3.4xlarge</a>
            instance in order to reduce compute time and ensure adequate memory capacity.

          <!-- create_matrix.py -->
          <p id="create_matrix.py">
            <b>create_matrix.py</b>This module runs as a separate utility to generate a scoring matrix based
            on the counts precomputed by <a href="#count_entities.py">count_entities.py</a>. This helps in
            fast calculation of TF-IDF score of tags at run-time. This module was run on an AWS

            <b>article.py: </b>This module is a wrapper around the actual article data covering every aspect
            of parsing, extracting tags, and other housekeeping. For the purposes of this project, it assumes
            that it will be processing an XML file on disk somewhere, but can easily be adapted by the AP to
            process files in cloud filesystems like S3, HDFS, or even stored over the network.

          <!-- api.py -->

            The following articles, with the AP's tags on the left and ours on the right, show some
            interesting results when comparing our system's tags
            with those identified by AP's taxonomy and metadata tagging system. The entities our system tags
            are generally more specific than the entities from AP's metadata syste. We have applied votes
            subjectively, and think these examples do an excellent job of showing the potential of our tool
            as both an internal rule validation mechanism, as well as client rating system when they add new
            content through the metadata tagging API.

            Below is an article about the death of Maroon 5 manager, Jordan
            Feldstein. The AP's system picks up actor Jonah Hill, and musician
            Rick Springfield, but misses the article's main topics - Jordan Feldstein and Maroon 5. Our
            system
            extracts those tags, as well as Career Artist Management, and Feldstein's other clients like
            Miguel and Elle King. These tag differences and additions
            are precisely the kind of feedback that would be helpful for management of rules, or
            adding our system's tags to their metadata to increase search relevance.

            and specifically a 'hero' named Chris Parker.
            The AP's system tags Ariana Grande and the bomber Salman Abedi, but misses ones our
            system tags like Manchester Arena, Chris Parker (the main focus of the
            article), Manchester Crown Court, and David Hernandez, a judge presiding over Parker's case.

            Armistice Day, Champs-Elysees, World War I, George Clemenceau, and the Arc de Triomphe. This is
            another excellent example of an article that could greatly increase its search relevance by

            The primary goal of this project was to help the Associated Press establish ground truth as well
            as
            increase search relevance of articles. This system will be a great help to the AP in validating
            the efficiency of their tagging rules, as well as
            improve their metadata service product by incorporating our tags, as often
            our system tags relevant entities the AP's tagging service did not.

            We hope the Associated Press will utilize the feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down) to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Compare their tags with tags generated by our system
            </li>
            <li>
              Check the efficacy of their tags and update their rules as required
            </li>
            <li>
              Collect feedback from clients in a structured manner outside sporatic emails or phonecalls
            </li>
          </ul>
          We have incorporated infrastructure to integrate the feedback mechanism into a bigger end-to-end
          system to
          which should allow the AP to use feedback more efficiently and effectively.
          <p>
            We recommend incorporating a semi-supervised system that
            utilizes the feedback collected by our thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback interface to automatically
            recompute and update rankings of both our system's tags, as well as those from the AP's system.
            That system
            could also make recommendations for tags that were not included by our or AP's system.
          </p>
          <p>
            We highly recommend that AP incorporate our system's tags into their metadata tagging
            system. By adding our named entities to their metadata, they will increase search
            relevance by including entities that may not be found in their current taxonomy.
